## :running::tv: Visualizing Jakob Ingebrigtsen's 1500 WR

A visualization tool designed to enhance the broadcast experience of middle and long-distance races, inspired by the dynamic visualizations showcased by World Athletics in recent championships, particularly for the jump and throw events. The tool provides real-time insights into athletes' pace, split times, and estimated finishing times, offering a more engaging and informative viewing experience. Ideal for broadcasters, this tool aims to bring the excitement of real-time data analysis to viewers, particularly during record attempts. This demo showcases the visualization of a world record-breaking 1500m run.
